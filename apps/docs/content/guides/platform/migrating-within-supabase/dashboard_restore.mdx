      <PostgresInstallation />

    <AccordionItem
      header="Create and configure a new Supabase project"
      id="item-2"
    >
      <StepHikeCompact>

      <StepHikeCompact.Step step={1}>
        <StepHikeCompact.Details title="Create New project" fullWidth>
          You can create a new [Supabase project here](https://database.new)
        </StepHikeCompact.Details>
      </StepHikeCompact.Step>

        <StepHikeCompact.Step step={2}>
          <StepHikeCompact.Details title="Configure your new project" fullWidth>
                In your new project:

                - If you were using Webhooks, enable [Database Webhooks](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/database/hooks).
                - If you were using any extensions, enable the [Extensions](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/database/extensions).
                - If you were using Replication for Realtime, enable [Publication](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/database/publications) on the tables where you had it enabled

## Restore backup

<StepHikeCompact>
  <StepHikeCompact.Step step={1}>
    <StepHikeCompact.Details title="Get your database password" fullWidth>
      If you do not have your database password, you can reset your database password in your
      [Database Settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/database)
    </StepHikeCompact.Details>
  </StepHikeCompact.Step>

<StepHikeCompact.Step step={2}>
  <StepHikeCompact.Details title="Check your backup file format" fullWidth>
    By default, your backup file might be gzipped and have a .gz file extension. You will need to
    decompress it and the file you use should look like this: **backup_name.backup**
  </StepHikeCompact.Details>
</StepHikeCompact.Step>

  <StepHikeCompact.Step step={3}>
    <StepHikeCompact.Details title="Restore your backup" fullWidth>
      Go to your [project page](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/) and click the connect button at the top of the page to get your project's connection string. It will look something like this:

      ```bash
        postgresql://postgres.[PROJECT-REF]:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@[HOST].supabase.com:5432/postgres
        ```

      You will want to use the direct connection string if you are able to (you need to have an IPv6 compatible network or have purchased the IPv4 addon). Otherwise, you will need to use the Session pooler connection string.

      Run this command after replacing the connection string as well as the password below with your connection string from your project:

      <StepHikeCompact.Code>

        ```sql
        psql -d "postgresql://postgres.[PROJECT-REF]:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@[HOST].supabase.com:5432/postgres" -f /path/to/your/file
        ```
      </StepHikeCompact.Code>

      <Admonition type="tip">
        For example, if you are running the command from your Desktop (Open terminal > run "cd Desktop") and your downloaded backup is in your Desktop folder, your /path/to/your/file could be "./db_cluster-29-05-2024@19-24-14.backup"
      </Admonition>
    </StepHikeCompact.Details>

  </StepHikeCompact.Step>

</StepHikeCompact>

## Migrate Storage Objects to S3 storage (optional)

After restoring the project above, the buckets and files will show up in the dashboard. However, the actual storage objects stored in S3 would not be present so it would cause issues if you try to retrieve or do any file operations.

You can use this [Google colab script](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uNh0fyWg27HuVmqMOj6piZOFZrTcG_KJ?usp=sharing) to migrate your downloaded storage objects to the new s3 buckets. Follow the instructions in the comments to fill out the required fields then run the scripts.
