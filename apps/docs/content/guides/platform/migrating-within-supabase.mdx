### How to Migrate your Database

You can migrate your database to a different Supabase project. For example, one possible reason you may need to do this is if your project has been paused for longer than 90 days and is no longer restorable.

If you have a dashboard backup file (\*.backup), follow the [Restore dashboard backup guide](/docs/guides/platform/migrating-within-supabase/dashboard_restore)

If you have SQL backup files (\*.sql), follow the [Backup and Restore using the CLI guide](/docs/guides/platform/migrating-within-supabase/backup-restore)

### Transfer my project to a different organization

Project migration is primarily for changing regions or upgrading to new major versions of the platform in some scenarios. If you need to move your project to a different organization without touching the infrastructure, see [project transfers](/docs/guides/platform/project-transfer).
