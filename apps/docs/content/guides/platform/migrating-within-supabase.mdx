title: Migrating within Supabase
subtitle: Migrate from one Supabase project to another

<Admonition type="tip">
  If you are on a Paid Plan and have physical backups enabled, you should use the [Restore to
  another project feature](https://supabase.com/blog/restore-to-a-new-project) in the dashboard.
</Admonition>

You can migrate your database to a different Supabase project. **One possible reason you may need to do this is if your project has been paused for longer than 90 days.**

## Transfer to a different organization

Note that project migration is primarily for changing regions or upgrading to new major versions of the platform in some scenarios. If you need to move your project to a different organization without touching the infrastructure, see [project transfers](/docs/guides/platform/project-transfer).
