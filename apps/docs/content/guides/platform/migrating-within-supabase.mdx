title: Migrating within Supabase
subtitle: Migrate from one Supabase project to another
---

<Admonition type="tip">
  You should use the [Restore to another project feature](https://supabase.com/blog/restore-to-a-new-project) if you are on a Paid Plan and have physical backups enabled
</Admonition>

You can migrate your database to a different Supabase project. **One possible reason you may need to do this is if your project has been paused for longer than 90 days.**

## Transfer to a different organization

Note that project migration is primarily for changing regions or upgrading to new versions of the platform from very old versions. If you need to move your project to a different organization without touching the infrastructure, see [project transfers](/docs/guides/platform/project-transfer).

    ### There are various errors like "permission denied" or "must be member of role "supabase_admin"". Should I be concerned with them?

    In most cases these errors are expected and should not be a concern. If there are any issues with your new project, please reach out to our Support here.
