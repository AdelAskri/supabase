subtitle: Migrate from one Supabase project to another

<Admonition type="caution">
  If you are on a Paid Plan and have physical backups enabled, you should instead use the [Restore
  to another project feature](https://supabase.com/blog/restore-to-a-new-project) in the dashboard.
</Admonition>

You can migrate your project database to a different Supabase project. One possible reason you may need to do this is if your project has been paused for longer than 90 days and is no longer restorable.

### Restore a backup downloaded from the dashboard to a new project

Follow our [Restore dashboard backup guide](/docs/guides/platform/migrating-within-supabase/dashboard_restore)

### Backup a old project or restore a CLI backup to a new project

Follow our [Backup and Restore using the CLI guide](/docs/guides/platform/migrating-within-supabase/backup)

### Transfer my project to a different organization

Project migration is primarily for changing regions or upgrading to new major versions of the platform in some scenarios. If you need to move your project to a different organization without touching the infrastructure, see [project transfers](/docs/guides/platform/project-transfer).
