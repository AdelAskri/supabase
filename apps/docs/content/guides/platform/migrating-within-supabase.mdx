title: Migrating within Supabase
subtitle: Migrate from one Supabase project to another
---

You can migrate your database to a different Supabase project. **One possible reason you may need to do this is if your project has been paused for longer than 90 days.**

<Admonition type="tip">
  If you are on a Paid Plan and have physical backups enabled, you will instead need to use the
  [Restore to another project feature](https://supabase.com/blog/restore-to-a-new-project).

## Transfer to a different organization

Note that project migration is primarily for changing regions or upgrading to new versions of the platform from very old versions. If you need to move your project to a different organization without touching the infrastructure, see [project transfers](/docs/guides/platform/project-transfer).
